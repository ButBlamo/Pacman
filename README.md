# Daniel Moloney C15446648 Pacman game
My pacman game

It is safe to say this assignment was both really fun and really tasking.

My main accomplishments were:

  I learned how to use a binary array in order to create collision physics on my game.
  
  My pacman has a moving mouth
  
  I used a sound file for the first time (Would have used more but the sound was pretty poor sadly.)
  
  Successfully implemented lasers (Sadly I couldn't figure out the highly complex ghost ai)
  
  Working life counter
  
  Score counter
  
  Unlike my last assignment, I made this assignment to run pretty well (or at least I hope so!). No more classes being declared in draw     etcetera.
  
  
  Sad points
  
  I couldn't find sound files that sounded nice.
  
  I couldn't figure out the harsh ghost ai (surprisingly complex!).
  
  I hadn't the time (my fault) to create a high score system with i/o
  
  Collision is a bit dodgy. I used .get in the boolean array for color indexing but it seemed to be flawed.
  
  
  
  Again, The diversity of these assignments allowed me to learn a lot about processing.
  
  
  Big room for improvement:
  
  I really need to sort out my time management skills. It is a crux for my assignments and I feel that If I used the bountiful time you   provided to me I could make something awesome! It is a big character flaw I need to work on.
